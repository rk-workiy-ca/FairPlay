I am going to create a Rummy card game , with user adding money to their account and with that money user can log in to Rummy card tables with other user ,  The app should only take a small cut of the table amount to let them play, but the game should be very fair within the participants ,
 if no participants avilable then a AI bot should play , The bot should be also in the same level as the player's level 
 The users from the table should be randomly selected from the available players who are looking to join a table 
 This app is to make sure Every user has a fair play of Rummy with very less to the App maker but provide a fair game to the users , 
 The app should also make sure the user has good experience with either 3 or 4 players , the number of players should be based on the happiness index of the player to play a card game in a table 
 Extract all the functional requirements 
The App should be able to handle 10K at a time. The app can be played using webside as well as  mobile app ,
